# Shipment
Owney (rhymes with Pony) is a tool to track  shipments. It is written in Python and uses the USPS webtools API. It also uses Django, mainly for its database ORM.  Owney is a work in progress. In fact, the current public release has not been tested by its author and there's lots of room for improvement.  Owney is named in honor of the famous dog. Woof!  Owney is comprised of several parts. They are:  database - The Shipments database. Contains data about each of your shipments. This is defined using django's ORM in the owney directory of this project.  add_shipments.py - a tool to load shipments into your database from an Endicia XML output file. This is in the tools directory.  watch_shipments.py - a tool to periodically update the status of each of your shipments. It needs to be run periodically. This is also in the tools directory.  A Django web interface to view and manage your shipments. This also lives in the owney subdirectory.
